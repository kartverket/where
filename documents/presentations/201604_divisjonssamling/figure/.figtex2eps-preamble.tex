% This is a preamble file for 'figtex2eps'. You may edit things
% here if necessary. Typically you might want to change the font
% size, the font or add some more packages for your latex commands
% in your figures. 
%
% If you make errors in here, rerun figtex2eps with '-v' (verbose) and
% check the error messages from latex, and then fix here.
% You may also just delete this file if you are in trouble
% and a new default one will be generated

\documentclass[fontsize=11pt]{scrartcl}

% Packages for most mathematical latex commands:
\usepackage{amsfonts}
\usepackage{amsmath}
\usepackage{amssymb}

\usepackage{ae}       % This is in case you also want to make pdf afterwards

% You might want the palatino font instead, then uncomment the following
% two lines, and do not use the ae package above
%\usepackage{palatino}
%\usepackage{palatcm} % Palatino math fonts 

\usepackage[dvips]{color}
\usepackage{epsfig}
