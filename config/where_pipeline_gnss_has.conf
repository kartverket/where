                                  are delivered by different Galileo signals. INAV messages are provided with E1 and 
                                  E5b signal and FNAV messages with E5a signal. That means for the mentioned navigation

                                     FNAV        FNAV messages coming with E5a signal, which is the same as FNAV_E5a.

                           The dataset used for the output can be defined in addition by optionally adding 
                           the processing 'stage' and the 'label' (e.g. rinex3_obs:read/None). Option 
                           'output:add_sections' is needed in addition. This option adds the writer configuration 
                           sections to the used configuration.
