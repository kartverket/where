                                    +/- 1 means that the day before and after the current day is read in addition

                                  Option 'removers:add_sections' is needed in addition. This option adds the removers

                                  should be written in the final ephemeris file. Following message types are handled of
                                  Where for a specified GNSS:

                                  For Galileo navigation messages it should be noted, that the INAV and FNAV messages
                                  are delivered by different Galileo signals. INAV messages are provided with E1 and 
                                  E5b signal and FNAV messages with E5a signal. That means for the mentioned navigation
                                  messages above:
                                     FNAV        FNAV messages coming with E5a signal, which is the same as FNAV_E5a.
                                     INAV        Mixed INAV messages coming from E1 or E5b signal.
                                     INAV_E1     INAV messages coming with E1 signal
                                     INAV_E5b    INAV messages coming with E5b signal
                                     INAV_E1E5b  Merged INAV messages based on E1 and E5b signal

                                  in the files.conf file. Otherwise the broadcast ephemeris files defined under the

                           The dataset used for the output can be defined in addition by optionally adding 
                           the processing 'stage' and the 'label' (e.g. rinex3_obs:read/None). Option 
                           'output:add_sections' is needed in addition. This option adds the writer configuration 
                           sections to the used configuration.
