filter_navigation_message:help   = Use either raw or filtered ephemeris data. The ephemeris are sorted by satellite in
                                  alphabetical order and transmission time. The first occurrence of a ephemeris block
                                  is kept and duplicated ephemeris blocks are removed.

navigation_message_type         = G:LNAV, E:INAV
navigation_message_type:option  = <system:message type>
navigation_message_type:help    = Specify navigation message types (e.g. INAV message for Galileo like 'E:INAV'), 
                                  which should be written in the final ephemeris file. Following message types are 
                                  handled of Where for a specified GNSS:
                                        Galileo (E): FNAV, FNAV_E5a, INAV, INAV_E1, INAV_E1b, INAV_E1E5b

                                  For Galileo navigation messages it should be noted, that the INAV and FNAV
                                  messages are delivered by different Galileo signals. INAV messages are provided 
                                  with E1 and E5b signal and FNAV messages with E5a signal. That means for the 
                                  mentioned navigation messages above:
                                        FNAV        FNAV messages coming with E5a signal, which is the same as

                                        INAV        Mixed INAV messages coming from E1 or E5b signal.
                                        INAV_E1     INAV messages coming with E1 signal
                                        INAV_E5b    INAV messages coming with E5b signal

                                                         unhealthy in broadcast ephemeris file. This is done also if a
                                                         satellite is unhealthy for a certain time period and not the
                                                         whole day.
                                     gnss_ignore_system: Ignore GNSS, which are defined for rejection..
                                     ignore_satellite:   Define satellites for which observations should be rejected.

                                  Option 'removers:add_sections' is needed in addition. This option adds the removers
                                  configuration sections to the used configuration.

                                  For example:
                                        +/- 0 means that only the current day is read
                                        +/- 1 means that the day before and after the current day is read in addition

                                  (QZSS) (e.g. systems = C G E). RINEX navigation files are often written separately
                                  for each GNSS, whereby the navigation file extension depends on the GNSS (GPS: *.n,
                                  Galileo: *.l, BeiDou: *.c, QZSS: *.j). The selection of GNSS defines, which 
                                  navigation files should be read. (Note: Option 'systems' is only relevant together
                                  with option 'use_mixed_brdc_file = False'.)

                                  identifiers 'E' (Galileo) and 'G' (GPS).
