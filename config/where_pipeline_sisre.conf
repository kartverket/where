                           The dataset used for the output can be defined in addition by optionally adding 
                           the processing 'stage' and the 'label' (e.g. sisre_writer:calculate/raw). In the case of 
                           SISRE analysis describes 'calculate/raw' SISRE results without and 'calculate/clean' with
                           outlier rejection. Option 'output:add_sections' is needed in addition. This option adds the
