# PRIORITY LIST
#______________________________________________________________________________________________________________________
#
[gnss_obs_priority]
:help   = The priority list is used for selection of GNSS observation types in Where analysis.

          A priority list is given for each GNSS, carrier phase, pseudorange, doppler and SNR observation type and 
          frequency, following the convention:

            <observation identifier> = <ordered observation types>

          The <observation identifier> definition follows the convention:

            <GNSS>_<L|C|D|S><freq>   (e.g. G_L1, E_D1)

          with
            GNSS     - GNSS constellation given by satellite system identifiers, which follows the RINEX convention 
                       (G-GPS, R-GLONASS, E-Galileo, C-BeiDou)
            L|C|D|S  - Carrier-phase, pseudorange, Doppler and SNR observation are indicated by L, C, D or S
            freq     - Frequency numbers representing single, dual or triple frequency selection. Frequency number and  
                       its meaning:
                         1           - observation types definition for single-frequency solution
                         1 and 2     - observation types definition for dual-frequency solution
                         1, 2 and 3  - observation types definition for triple-frequency solution

          The <ordered observation types> is the priority list given for a certain <observation identifier>. The  
          observation type defined in the priority list follow the RINEX 2.11 and 3.03 convention. Observation types 
          for RINEX 2.11 and 3.03 should be defined, because Where can read either RINEX files in RINEX format 2.11 or 
          3.03. The order of the priority list is important for selection of observation type for the Where analysis. 
          Following steps are carried out for the selection:

            1. Read RINEX observation files given in format 2.11 or 3.03.
            2. Get observation types given in RINEX observation file.
            3. Select observation types given in RINEX file depending on configuration (e.g. single- or dual-frequency; 
               code or both code and carrier phase observation) and priority list for further Where analysis. Hereby 
               the first observation type in the priority list, which matches the given RINEX observation types, is 
               selected for the Where analysis.

          EXAMPLE:

            Priority list:
                    G_L1    =  L1, L1P, L1C, L1W, L1X

                    G_C2    =  P2,  C2, C2P, C2C, C2D, C2S, C2L, C2W, C2X
                    G_C3    =  C5, C5Q, C5X
   
            The RINEX file is given in RINEX format 2.11 with following GPS observation types C1, C2, C5, P1, P2, L1, 
            L2 and L5. If the configuration options <freq_type = dual> and <obs_code = code,phase> are used, then from 
            the observation identifiers G_L1, G_L2, G_C1 and G_C2 the observation types L1, L2, P1 and P2 are selected 
            for the Where analysis. If the configuration options <freq_type = single> and <obs_code = code> are used,  
            then from the observation code G_C1 the observation type P1 is selected for the Where analysis.
