# List of custom positions used by apriori.get('trf', ...)
#
# Each site should be defined as its own section. The section header is used as
# a key in the TRF. It must have a field called pos_itrs, with the
# coordinates. If vel_itrs is defined ref_epoch must also be defined. If a velocity
# is not provided the posistion is assumed to be constant. Is is also recommended
# to define a name.
# The other fields are made available as meta information.
